#  Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my technical portfolio! This repository documents my hands-on experience and progress as I transition into the cybersecurity field. My focus is on mastering Linux administration, network security, and defensive operations.

##  Skills & Tools
- **Operating Systems:** Advanced use of Linux (Kali Linux, Ubuntu) via Command Line Interface (CLI).
- **Networking:** Connectivity diagnostics, DNS resolution, and port monitoring.
- **System Administration:** Process management, signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGKILL), and package management (APT).
- **Version Control:** Professional use of Git and GitHub for technical documentation.

##  Labs & Projects

### [Lab 01: Linux Process Manipulation](./Linux_Processes.md)
* **Topic:** Managing system resources and understanding kernel signals.
* **Key Learning:** Mastered `top`, `ps`, and `kill` commands to monitor and secure system activity*
* **Technical Highlights:**
  * Process lifecycle management using `top`, `ps`, and `kill`.
  * Implementation of **File System Security** using `chmod` octal modes.
  * Verified access control (Confidentiality) by testing permission denials for non-owner users..

### [Lab 02: Network Reconnaissance & Threat Hunting](./Networking_Lab.md)
* **Technical Highlights:**
  * Network surface mapping using `nmap` and `ip addr`.
  * Identification of active services and unauthorized listening ports.
  * **Threat Hunting Simulation:** Detecting and neutralizing persistent processes.
  * Implementation of Incident Response SOP (Standard Operating Procedures).
